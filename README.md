## MXoid

MXoid is my set of helpers I use when working with MXNet modeled heavily
off of my workflow using Blocks and Theano.
Currently this code is highly unstable and not developed for use by
others.
It is public for those who are curious to see more MXNet code.

## What is currently here

* A few extra cost operations in symbol.py
* A training loop in loop.py
* Extensions to the training loop in extensions.py
